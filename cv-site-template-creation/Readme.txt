<p>##index.html##
In this repository is an index.html that's used for the "core" content (wording etc) of the resume, it has place holders that are to be customised by you. There is a guide on how to edit this [found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DwScjDKaCE8-Vnj9fgPKc3BpmDvHG0RgfQvYy1RceNc/edit#).</p>

<p>##assets/css/style.css##
This is the main style sheet for the website, you can customise this how you like, we've added some documentation at the bottom of the guide found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DwScjDKaCE8-Vnj9fgPKc3BpmDvHG0RgfQvYy1RceNc/edit#). We'd recommend doing some research into how to use CSS.</p>
